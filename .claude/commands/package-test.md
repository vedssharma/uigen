Your goal is to make sure all the npm dependencies are up to date and compatible with each other.

### Here are the steps:
1. Take a look at @package.json.
2. For each of the npm packages in that file, make sure they are the latest version.
3. If they are not, install the latest version.
4. Make sure to make any code changes based on dependency version updates if needed.
